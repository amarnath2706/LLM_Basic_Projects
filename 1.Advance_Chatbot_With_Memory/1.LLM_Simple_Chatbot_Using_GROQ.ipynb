    "A chatbot app is a software application designed to simulate conversation with human users. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to understand what someone is saying and to respond with appropriate answers. These apps can be used for various purposes like customer support, providing information, or entertainment. Essentially, it's like texting with a program that can answer questions and help with tasks.\n",
